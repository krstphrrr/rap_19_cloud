### What is RAP?

The Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) is an interactive web application designed
to assist in managing and monitoring America's valuable rangelands. This free
tool was developed for landowners, managers, and conservationists to quickly and
easily access information that can guide land use decisions.

### Why is it useful?

The vast grazing lands that span the United States are irreplaceable assets
that produce food, support rural economies, generate recreation revenues, and
sustain wildlife. The RAP is an innovative new way to monitor the natural
resources that comprise these working rangelands, which will help landowners and
managers to keep them profitable and productive for future generations.

### How can it be used?

The RAP is designed to be used alongside local knowledge and on-the-ground data
to plan management actions that improve rangelands and wildlife habitat. Data
provided through the RAP will include forage productivity, vegetation cover,
riparian condition and sensitivity, climate and drought monitoring, and more.

### Why is it innovative?

The RAP provides the ability to monitor rangelands across time and space. By
combining the latest remote-sensing technology with massive satellite imagery
archives, the RAP is the first-ever all-encompassing view of millions of acres
of rangelands.

Its datasets allow users to monitor trends and changes at the pasture,
landscape, or regional scales from 1984 to present. That’s nearly 40 years of
detailed data available as fast as you can click your mouse!

### Who developed it?

The RAP was created in collaboration with the USDA’s Natural Resources
Conservation Service, the DOI's Bureau of Land Management, and the University of
Montana. The application was developed by Jeremy Malczyk of Plutonic.
