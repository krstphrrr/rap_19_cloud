<h3>Where are large fires most likely to occur throughout the year given an
ignition?</h3>

These maps represent the relative probability of large (> 1,000 acres) rangeland
fire given an ignition. Probabilities are for the entire year or fire season.
Maps should be used alongside other fire risk or prediction services.
Probabilities are calculated using RAP biomass, RAP cover, and various
climate/drought indices. Maps are updated every 16 days through early June.

<h3>How does this year compare to the past?</h3>

There is a clear relationship between the area-wide average fire probability
across the Great Basin in the month of May and the total area burned that year
(see figure below). 2021 is shown as a yellow dot (which moves every 16-days
based on the probability map) and represents a coarse prediction of the total
area burned for 2021. This allows us to compare how the coming fire season might
relate to past years in terms of total area burned. This prediction, however,
entails considerable uncertainty. Besides fuels, the severity of the fire season
depends on variables such as fire weather, ignitions, and fire suppression
resource availability that cannot be predicted months in advance.

<h3>What do past years look like?</h3>

The figure below shows the total area burned each year (large wildfires >1,000
acres) in the Great Basin. Bars are color-coded to display how much of that area
was in each probability category by May of that year. The overwhelming majority
of wildfire occurred in areas with probabilities >0.5 (warm colors). Areas with
lower probabilities (cold colors) burned much less.
