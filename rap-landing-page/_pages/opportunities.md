Our primary goal is to hire good individuals who thrive working in cooperative
and dynamic team environments with university, agency, and landowner partners.
Individuals will join a fantastic team of six research scientists and one
research technician at the University of Montana. Individuals should be
enthusiastic and self-motivated, and willing to provide guidance, leadership and
new perspectives to help instill remotely sensed information into agency
actions.

We particularly welcome individuals from under-represented groups including
women, Native/African/Latinx Americans, and LGBTQ+.
