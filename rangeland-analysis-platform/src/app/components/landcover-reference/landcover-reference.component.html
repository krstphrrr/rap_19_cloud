    <h2>Mesic Resources</h2>

    <p>This layer depicts the estimated extent and availability of mesic resources through time across the entire range of sage grouse. Mesic resources are defined here as sites with higher vegetative productivity during the late growing season (July 15 to September 30) relative to surrounding areas, including temporary wetlands, wet meadows, riparian areas, high-elevation sagebrush uplands, and irrigated fields. This late growing season correspond with brood-rearing season for sage grouse. This layer does not incorporate actual sage grouse habitat use, so it should be combined with local knowledge and habitat use data whenever possible.</p>
    <p>Mesic resources were estimated from Landsat satellite imagery (30-m pixel resolution) using normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI), which quantify photosynthetic activity and correlate closely to fluctuations in net primary productivity. In other words, NDVI is a measure of ‘greenness’.  Estimations were generated annually from 1984 to 2016*.  NDVI values were calculated as the mean of all Landsat data available between July 15 and September 30 of each year. NDVI results were summarized within polygons representative of mesic sites by calculating the mean of NDVI pixels that occurred within their boundaries.  Mesic polygons were generated from Landsat imagery using an object analysis that grouped mesic pixels into homogeneous clusters to define polygon extents. An attempt was made to remove areas exhibiting NDVI values similar to mesic resources that were not representative of sage grouse late brood rearing sites, including sites with conifers and certain agricultural crops. The mapping methodology largely followed Donnelly et al. 2016, but was improved to capture higher elevation sagebrush uplands that remain productive in late summer.</p>
    <p>Users can visualize the data in two ways: 1) percentage of years the mesic resource was productive (NDVI > 0.3) averaged over the mapped polygon, or 2) annual variability in mesic resource productivity within mapped polygons. Users can also click on a polygon to view a time series chart of productivity during specific years.</p>
    <p>For areas not captured by the layer, users can draw/import their own polygon(s) and generate custom mesic resource layers. After toggling the layer on, use the drawing tools in the upper left hand corner to draw polygons. Alternatively, a zipped shapefile of polygons can be uploaded. The zipped file must contain the .shp, .prj, and .shx files of the shapefile, and must only contain 2D geometries. Individual polygons must be smaller than 640 acres and the total number of polygons is limited to 50.</p>
